  - Error frequency analysis

**Learning Process:**
1. Collect data from all sources
2. Generate insights across categories
3. Prioritize insights by impact and confidence
4. Take automated actions for high-confidence insights
5. Measure improvements
6. Store learning cycles for future reference

**Insight Categories:**
- Conversion optimization opportunities
- Performance bottlenecks
- Monetization improvements
- User experience enhancements
- Infrastructure optimizations

### 5. Business Readiness Orchestrator
**Location:** `apps/web/src/lib/businessReadinessOrchestrator.ts`

**Features:**
- Central coordinator for all business readiness systems
- Comprehensive readiness reports with scoring
- Business metrics tracking:
  - Conversion rate
  - Average revenue per user
  - Customer acquisition cost
  - Lifetime value
  - Churn rate
  - Monthly recurring revenue

**Assessment Categories:**
1. Code Quality (15% weight)
2. CRO Optimization (25% weight)
3. Monetization (25% weight)
4. Infrastructure (20% weight)
5. Autonomous Systems (15% weight)

## API Endpoints

2. `funnel_events` - Funnel stage tracking
3. `learning_insights` - Stored insights from learning cycles
4. `learning_cycles` - Learning cycle results
5. `infrastructure_health` - Infrastructure health snapshots
6. `self_healing_actions` - Log of self-healing actions
7. `business_readiness_reports` - Readiness reports
8. `marketplace_items` - Marketplace product catalog
9. `affiliate_conversions` - Affiliate tracking
10. `enterprise_quotes` - Enterprise sales pipeline
11. `data_licenses` - Data licensing agreements
12. `revenue_records` - Revenue tracking

## Usage Examples

### Initialize Systems
```typescript
import { businessReadinessOrchestrator } from '@/lib/businessReadinessOrchestrator';

await businessReadinessOrchestrator.initialize();
```

### Get Business Readiness Report
```typescript
const report = await businessReadinessOrchestrator.generateBusinessReadinessReport(tenantId);
console.log(`Overall Score: ${report.overall_score}/100`);
```

### Track CTA Interaction
```typescript
import { croOptimizer } from '@/lib/croOptimizer';

await croOptimizer.trackCTAInteraction(
  'cta-123',
  'click',
  userId,
  { page: 'home', section: 'hero' }
);
```
