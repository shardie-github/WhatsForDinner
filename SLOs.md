# Service Level Objectives (SLOs)

This document defines the Service Level Objectives for What's For Dinner, including availability, latency, and error rate targets.

## Overview

SLOs define the reliability and performance expectations for our service. They are used to:
- Set clear reliability targets
- Guide engineering decisions
- Enable error budget management
- Drive incident response priorities

## SLO Definitions

### 1. Availability SLOs

- **Measurement**: Successful HTTP responses (2xx, 3xx) / Total requests
- **Window**: 30-day rolling window
- **Error Budget**: 0.1% (43.2 minutes/month)

#### Core User Journeys
- **Target**: 99.5% availability
- **Measurement**: Successful completion of critical user flows
- **Window**: 30-day rolling window
- **Error Budget**: 0.5% (3.6 hours/month)

### 2. Latency SLOs

#### API Response Time
- **Target**: 95% of requests < 500ms
- **Measurement**: P95 latency across all API endpoints
- **Window**: 30-day rolling window
- **Error Budget**: 5% of requests can exceed 500ms

#### Page Load Time
- **Target**: 95% of pages load < 2s
- **Measurement**: P95 First Contentful Paint (FCP)
- **Window**: 30-day rolling window
- **Error Budget**: 5% of pages can exceed 2s

#### Database Query Time
- **Target**: 95% of queries < 100ms
- **Measurement**: P95 database query latency
- **Window**: 30-day rolling window
- **Error Budget**: 5% of queries can exceed 100ms

### 3. Error Rate SLOs

#### API Error Rate
- **Target**: < 0.1% error rate
- **Measurement**: 4xx/5xx responses / Total requests
- **Window**: 30-day rolling window
- **Error Budget**: 0.1% error rate allowed

#### Business Logic Errors
- **Target**: < 0.5% error rate
- **Measurement**: Failed business operations / Total operations
- **Window**: 30-day rolling window
- **Error Budget**: 0.5% error rate allowed

## Critical User Journeys (CUJs)

### 1. User Registration
**Path**: Landing page → Sign up → Email verification → Dashboard
**SLO**: 99.5% success rate, < 5s total time
**Error Budget**: 0.5% failure rate

### 2. Meal Generation
**Path**: Dashboard → Preferences → Generate meal → View results
**SLO**: 99.0% success rate, < 10s total time
**Error Budget**: 1.0% failure rate

### 3. Payment Processing
**Path**: Upgrade → Payment form → Stripe → Confirmation
**SLO**: 99.9% success rate, < 3s total time
**Error Budget**: 0.1% failure rate

### 4. Meal Planning
**Path**: Dashboard → Plan meals → Save plan → Export
**SLO**: 99.0% success rate, < 8s total time
**Error Budget**: 1.0% failure rate

### 5. User Authentication
**Path**: Login → Authentication → Session → Dashboard
**SLO**: 99.9% success rate, < 2s total time
**Error Budget**: 0.1% failure rate

## Error Budget Management

### Error Budget Calculation
```
Error Budget = (100% - SLO Target) × Time Window
```

### Example Calculations
- **API Availability**: (100% - 99.9%) × 30 days = 0.1% × 30 days = 43.2 minutes
- **API Latency**: 5% of requests can exceed 500ms
- **API Error Rate**: 0.1% error rate allowed

### Error Budget Consumption
- **Green**: < 50% of budget consumed
- **Yellow**: 50-80% of budget consumed
- **Red**: > 80% of budget consumed
- **Critical**: > 100% of budget consumed

### Error Budget Actions
- **Green**: Continue normal operations
- **Yellow**: Increase monitoring, prepare for potential issues
- **Red**: Freeze deployments, investigate issues
- **Critical**: Emergency response, rollback if necessary

## SLO Monitoring

### Metrics Collection
- **Availability**: HTTP status codes, business logic success rates
- **Latency**: Response times, database query times, page load times
- **Error Rate**: 4xx/5xx responses, business logic failures

### Alerting Thresholds
- **Warning**: 80% of error budget consumed
- **Critical**: 100% of error budget consumed
- **Emergency**: 120% of error budget consumed

### Dashboard Requirements
- Real-time SLO status
- Error budget consumption
- Trend analysis
- Historical performance
- Alert status

## Release Gates

### Pre-Release Checks
1. **SLO Compliance**: All SLOs must be within target
2. **Error Budget**: Must have > 20% error budget remaining
3. **Performance**: No performance regressions
4. **Security**: No security vulnerabilities
5. **Tests**: All tests passing

### Release Blocking Conditions
- Any SLO below target
- Error budget < 20%
- Performance regression > 10%
- Security vulnerabilities
- Failed tests

### Post-Release Monitoring
- Monitor SLOs for 24 hours post-release
- Watch error budget consumption
- Track performance metrics
- Monitor user feedback

## SLO Review Process

### Monthly Reviews
- Analyze SLO performance
- Review error budget consumption
- Identify trends and patterns
- Adjust SLOs if necessary

### Quarterly Reviews
- Comprehensive SLO analysis
- Business impact assessment
- SLO target adjustments
- Process improvements

### Annual Reviews
- Complete SLO strategy review
- Business alignment check
- Technology stack impact
- Long-term planning

## Implementation
