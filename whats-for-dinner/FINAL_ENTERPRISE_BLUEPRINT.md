# Final Enterprise Blueprint: What's for Dinner Federated Ecosystem

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the complete transformation of "What's for Dinner" into a federated, API-monetized ecosystem with global integrations, intelligent revenue automation, and partner-driven expansion. The system has been unified into a self-sustaining cloud ecosystem with adaptive APIs, partner federation, and embedded intelligence for revenue, compliance, and collaboration.

## Architecture Overview

### 1. Federated API Network

The system now operates as a unified federated API with the following components:

#### Core Federation Gateway (`/api/federation`)

- **Gateway Proxy**: Routes requests to third-party plugin APIs (Shopify, Zapier, Alexa, Google Home)
- **OAuth2 + JWT Authentication**: Normalized auth across all integrations
- **Regional Load Balancing**: Distributes load across Supabase instances (NA, EU, APAC)
- **Distributed Rate Limiting**: Implemented via Supabase Edge Middleware

#### Integration Pipeline (`/api/integrations/*`)

- **Shopify Meal Kit Extensions**: E-commerce integration for meal kit sales
- **Zapier Automations**: Workflow automation for recipe management

### 2. Partner Ecosystem Registry

#### Partner Management System

```sql
-- Partner Registry Schema
CREATE TABLE partner_registry (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  type TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (type IN (
    'shopify', 'zapier', 'alexa', 'google_home', 'tiktok', 'instagram',
    'api_integration', 'white_label', 'franchise', 'affiliate'
  )),
  api_base TEXT NOT NULL,
  revenue_share_percent NUMERIC(5,2) DEFAULT 0.0,
  status TEXT DEFAULT 'pending' CHECK (status IN ('pending', 'active', 'suspended', 'terminated')),
  region TEXT DEFAULT 'global' CHECK (region IN ('global', 'na', 'eu', 'apac')),
