## ? Resolved Critical Gaps

### 1. Error Tracking & Monitoring ?

**Problem**: No error tracking system in place  
**Solution Implemented**:
- ? Configured Sentry for error tracking (client, server, and edge)
- ? Created `sentry.client.config.ts`, `sentry.server.config.ts`, and `sentry.edge.config.ts`
- ? Integrated with Next.js via `withSentryConfig`
- ? Configured sensitive data filtering and privacy protection
- ? Set up proper error sampling rates (10% in production, 100% in development)

**Files Created/Modified**:
- `apps/web/sentry.client.config.ts` (NEW)
- `apps/web/sentry.server.config.ts` (NEW)
- `apps/web/sentry.edge.config.ts` (NEW)
- `apps/web/next.config.ts` (UPDATED)

---

### 2. Analytics & User Tracking ?

**Problem**: No analytics tracking configured  
**Solution Implemented**:
- ? Created `Analytics.tsx` component supporting both PostHog and Google Analytics
- ? Implemented automatic page view tracking
- ? Added event tracking helper function
- ? Integrated analytics component into root layout
- ? Updated CSP headers to allow analytics scripts

**Files Created/Modified**:
- `apps/web/src/components/Analytics.tsx` (NEW)

- `apps/web/src/middleware.ts` (UPDATED - CSP)

---

### 3. Rate Limiting Improvements ?

**Problem**: Basic rate limiting without environment configuration and strict auth limits  
**Solution Implemented**:
- ? Enhanced rate limiting with environment variable support
- ? Added stricter limits for authentication endpoints (5 req/min)
- ? Added stricter limits for billing endpoints (10 req/min)
- ? Configurable via `RATE_LIMIT_REQUESTS` and `RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW` env vars
- ? Proper rate limit headers in responses

**Files Modified**:
- `apps/web/src/middleware.ts` (UPDATED)

---

### 4. Security Headers & CSP ?

**Problem**: Incomplete security headers and CSP configuration  
**Solution Implemented**:
- ? Added HSTS header (Strict-Transport-Security) for production
- ? Enhanced Content Security Policy with:
  - Analytics domains (Google Analytics, PostHog, Sentry)
  - Frame-src 'none' (prevents clickjacking)
  - Object-src 'none' (prevents plugin embedding)
  - Upgrade-insecure-requests
- ? Maintained existing security headers (X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, etc.)

**Files Modified**:
- `apps/web/src/middleware.ts` (UPDATED)

---

### 5. Input Validation & Sanitization ?

**Problem**: Basic validation without XSS and SQL injection protection  
**Solution Implemented**:
- ? Created `sanitizeString()` function to prevent XSS attacks
- ? Added SQL injection detection with `validateNoSqlInjection()`
- ? Enhanced all validation schemas with:
  - Maximum length limits
  - Input sanitization transforms
  - SQL injection pattern detection
- ? Added secure string schemas (`SecureStringSchema`, `SanitizedStringSchema`)
- ? Enhanced Recipe, PantryItem, and UserProfile schemas with security transforms

**Files Modified**:
- `apps/web/src/lib/validation.ts` (MAJOR UPDATE)

- ? Created GDPR/CCPA-compliant Privacy Policy (`/privacy-policy`)
- ? Added legal links to footer navigation
- ? Both documents accessible at public URLs

**Files Created**:
- `apps/web/public/terms-of-service.html` (NEW)

---

### 7. Monitoring & Alerting ?

**Problem**: No centralized alerting configuration  
**Solution Implemented**:
- ? Created `monitoringAlerts.ts` with comprehensive alert configuration
- ? Configured thresholds for:
  - Error rates (warning: 5%, critical: 10%)
  - API latency (warning: 1s, critical: 3s)
  - Database connection pool exhaustion
  - Security events (unauthorized access, SQL injection attempts)
  - Cost alerts (warning: $100/day, critical: $500/day)
- ? Support for multiple notification channels:
  - Slack webhooks
  - Email (SMTP)
  - PagerDuty integration
- ? Environment-based configuration

**Files Created**:
- `apps/web/src/lib/monitoringAlerts.ts` (NEW)

---

### 8. Support Channel Setup ?

**Problem**: No support channel or documentation

- ? Included contact information (email addresses)
- ? Added links to Terms of Service and Privacy Policy
- ? Added support link to footer

**Files Created**:
- `apps/web/src/app/support/page.tsx` (NEW)
- `apps/web/src/app/layout.tsx` (UPDATED - footer)

---

### 9. CI/CD Security Enhancements ?

**Problem**: Security audits not automated in CI/CD  
**Solution Implemented**:
- ? Added security audit step to CI/CD pipeline
- ? Added dependency vulnerability scanning with `pnpm audit`
- ? Security checks run on every PR and push
- ? Failures are non-blocking but logged

**Files Modified**:
- `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml` (UPDATED)

---

### 10. Environment Configuration ?

**Problem**: Missing analytics and monitoring environment variables in template  
**Solution Implemented**:
- ? Already present in `.env.example` (verified)
- ? Added documentation for Sentry, PostHog, Google Analytics configuration
