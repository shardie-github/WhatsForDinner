## 💬 New Narrative

### Hero Variants

**Variant A (Problem-Focused):**
- Headline: "Never stare at your pantry confused again"
- Subheadline: "Our AI learns your pantry and suggests recipes you'll actually want to make—in under 30 seconds."

**Variant B (Outcome-Focused):**
- Headline: "From pantry to plate in 30 seconds"
- Subheadline: "Stop wondering what's for dinner. Get AI-powered recipes that fit your kitchen, your diet, and your schedule."

**Variant C (Proof-Focused):**
- Headline: "10,000+ recipes generated this month"
- Subheadline: "Join thousands using AI to plan meals from ingredients they already have. Save 15 minutes per meal."

### One-Liner Value Prop
> "What's for Dinner is the AI meal planner that learns your pantry, preferences, and cooking style—suggesting personalized recipes in seconds so you never stare at ingredients confused again."

## 📈 Updated Market Fit Score

**Before**: 42/100  
**Target (90 days)**: 70/100  
**Week 1 Target**: 44/100 (+2 points)

**Rationale**:
- +1 point from landing variants (differentiation test)
- +1 point from messaging refresh (emotional hooks, proof points)
- Experiments infrastructure enables data-driven optimization (foundation for future improvement)

## 🚨 Risks & Blockers

**Blockers**: None

**Risks**:
1. RLS policies may need adjustment in staging
   - **Mitigation**: Test all user roles before production
2. Experiment allocation may need tuning
   - **Mitigation**: Monitor conversion rates, adjust if needed
3. Stripe price IDs need to be set in environment
   - **Mitigation**: Document in deployment checklist
