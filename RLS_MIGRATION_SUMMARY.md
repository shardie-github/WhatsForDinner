# RLS Migration and Security Consolidation Summary

## Date: 2025-01-21
## Status: ✅ Complete

## Overview

This document summarizes the consolidation of Row Level Security (RLS) policies and mitigation of blockers/risks identified in the project.

## Changes Made

### 1. Consolidated RLS Migration ✅

**File**: `whats-for-dinner/supabase/migrations/014_consolidated_rls_security.sql`

**Purpose**: 
- Consolidates all RLS policies following best practices
- Provides role-based access control for all roles
- Ensures proper tenant isolation
- Replaces conflicting/outdated migrations

**Key Features**:
- ✅ Role creation: `app_user`, `app_admin`, `app_super_admin`, `app_readonly`
- ✅ Security helper functions: `user_belongs_to_tenant()`, `get_user_tenants()`, `is_tenant_owner()`, etc.
- ✅ Comprehensive RLS policies for all core tables
- ✅ Tenant-aware policies with proper isolation
- ✅ Admin and readonly role policies
- ✅ Proper `WITH CHECK` clauses for insert/update operations
- ✅ Security definer functions for performance

### 2. Deprecated Conflicting Migration ✅

**File**: `whats-for-dinner/supabase/migrations/003_rbac_rls_security.sql`

**Action**: Added deprecation notice at the top explaining:
- File is outdated and contains references to non-existent tables (`users` instead of `profiles`)
- Should not be run
- Replaced by `014_consolidated_rls_security.sql`

### 3. Fixed CI/CD Pipeline Scripts ✅

**Changes**:
- Updated `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml` to use `npx tsx` for TypeScript files
- Updated `package.json` script `rls:test` to use `npx tsx`
- Verified `db-slowquery-check.mjs` exists and is referenced correctly

**Files Updated**:
- `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`: Fixed RLS smoke test command
- `package.json`: Updated rls:test script

## RLS Policy Coverage

### Core Tables (with tenant isolation)
- ✅ `profiles` - Tenant-aware select/update/insert
- ✅ `pantry_items` - Full CRUD with tenant isolation
- ✅ `recipes` - Full CRUD with tenant isolation
- ✅ `favorites` - Select/insert/delete with tenant isolation

### Multi-Tenant Tables
- ✅ `tenants` - View own tenants, owners can update
- ✅ `tenant_memberships` - View own memberships, owners can manage
- ✅ `subscriptions` - View own subscriptions, system manages
- ✅ `usage_logs` - View own tenant usage, system inserts
- ✅ `tenant_invites` - Owners can manage
- ✅ `ai_cache` - Tenant-isolated access, system manages
- ✅ `billing_events` - System-only access

### Analytics Tables
- ✅ `analytics_events` - Tenant-isolated select, system inserts
- ✅ `recipe_metrics` - Tenant-isolated select, system inserts
- ✅ `recipe_feedback` - Tenant-isolated CRUD

### Other Tables
- ✅ All tables from migrations 004-013 have RLS enabled
- ✅ Tables defined in their respective migrations maintain their policies
- ✅ Consolidated migration ensures role-based access where appropriate

## Role-Based Access Control

### app_user
- ✅ Can SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE on tables in their tenants
- ✅ Restricted by RLS policies to tenant data only

### app_admin
- ✅ Can view all data (with RLS still enforcing tenant isolation)
- ✅ Additional admin-only policies for system oversight

### app_super_admin
- ✅ Full access to all tables (RLS still enforced but broader scope)
- ✅ Can execute all functions

### app_readonly
- ✅ Read-only access to tenant data
- ✅ No INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE permissions

## Security Best Practices Implemented

1. **Explicit Policies**: Every table has explicit policies for each operation
2. **WITH CHECK Clauses**: All INSERT/UPDATE policies include proper WITH CHECK clauses
3. **Security Definer Functions**: Helper functions use SECURITY DEFINER for performance
4. **Tenant Isolation**: All multi-tenant tables properly isolate data by tenant_id
5. **Role Hierarchy**: Proper role-based permissions with clear hierarchy
6. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Each role has minimum required permissions

## Testing

### RLS Smoke Test
**Script**: `scripts/rls-smoke.ts`

**Tests**:
- ✅ Anonymous users cannot access protected data
- ✅ Anonymous users cannot insert/update/delete data
- ✅ Service role can access data (bypasses RLS as expected)
- ✅ Tenant isolation verified

**CI/CD Integration**: 
- Runs as part of test job in CI/CD pipeline
- Uses `npx tsx` to execute TypeScript file
- Fails pipeline if any security checks fail

## Migration Order

The consolidated migration runs **after** all table creation migrations:
1. 001-013: Table creation migrations
2. **014**: Consolidated RLS security (this migration)
3. Future migrations can extend or modify policies as needed

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Test RLS policies
pnpm rls:test

# Run database performance checks
pnpm db:perf

# Run health checks
pnpm health:check

# Full CI/CD validation
pnpm lint && pnpm type-check && pnpm test && pnpm rls:test
```

## Risk Mitigation

### Identified Risks → Solutions

1. **Conflicting Migrations** ✅
   - **Risk**: Two 003_ migrations with conflicting policies
   - **Solution**: Consolidated into single migration, deprecated old one

2. **Missing RLS Policies** ✅
   - **Risk**: Some tables may not have proper RLS
   - **Solution**: Comprehensive coverage in consolidated migration

3. **Incorrect Table References** ✅
   - **Risk**: Old migration referenced `users` table that doesn't exist
   - **Solution**: Updated to use correct `profiles` table

4. **CI/CD Script Failures** ✅
   - **Risk**: TypeScript files not executing in CI/CD
   - **Solution**: Updated to use `npx tsx` for TypeScript execution

5. **Incomplete Tenant Isolation** ✅
   - **Risk**: Policies may not properly enforce tenant isolation
   - **Solution**: All policies use `get_user_tenants()` helper function

6. **Role Permissions Not Defined** ✅
   - **Risk**: Custom roles created without proper permissions
   - **Solution**: Explicit GRANT statements for all roles

## Next Steps

1. ✅ **Deploy migration**: Run `014_consolidated_rls_security.sql` in staging
2. ✅ **Run tests**: Execute RLS smoke tests to verify policies
3. ✅ **Monitor**: Check for any RLS-related errors in logs
4. ⏳ **Production deploy**: After staging verification, deploy to production
5. ⏳ **Documentation**: Update developer docs with RLS best practices

## Notes

- The old `003_rbac_rls_security.sql` migration is kept for reference but should not be executed
- Tables created in migrations 010-013 (community, chef marketplace, etc.) maintain their existing policies as they are appropriate for those use cases
- This consolidation ensures consistency across the core multi-tenant tables while preserving specialized policies where needed

## Success Criteria

✅ All tables have RLS enabled
✅ All roles have proper permissions
✅ Tenant isolation enforced across all multi-tenant tables
✅ CI/CD pipeline passes all checks
✅ RLS smoke tests pass
✅ No security vulnerabilities identified
