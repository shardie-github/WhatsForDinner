- **Fixed invalid Radix UI packages** causing 404 errors
- **Impact:** Reduced repository size, eliminated confusion, improved maintainability
- **Deliverable:** `REPORTS/cleanup.md`

### 3. Type-Safety Uplift
- **Fixed file extension issues** (theme.ts → theme.tsx)
- **Consolidated TypeScript configuration** and removed duplicate options
- **Updated test files** to use correct API methods
- **Excluded test files** from main TypeScript compilation
- **Deliverable:** `REPORTS/types.md`

### 4. Lint/Format Standardization
- **Created ESLint 9 flat config** for modern compatibility
- **Added comprehensive globals** for browser, Node.js, Jest, React
- **Fixed Prettier formatting** across codebase
- **Resolved configuration compatibility** issues
- **Deliverable:** `REPORTS/linting.md`

### 5. Dependency Hygiene & Security
- **Upgraded Next.js 15.0.0 → 16.0.0** (critical security fix)
- **Resolved 7 out of 8 security vulnerabilities** (87.5% improvement)
- **Fixed critical authorization bypass** vulnerability
- **Eliminated 5 moderate security issues** (DoS, SSRF, content injection)
- **Deliverable:** `REPORTS/deps.md`

## 📊 Key Metrics

### Security Improvements
