# Structure Cleanup & Pruning Report

**Date:** 2025-01-26  
**Branch:** chore/repo-cleanup-full-20251026

## Summary

This report documents the structural cleanup and pruning performed on the whats-for-dinner-monorepo to improve maintainability and reduce technical debt.

## Actions Taken

### 1. Removed Disabled/Legacy Applications
**Removed directories:**
- `apps/admin.disabled/` - Disabled admin interface
- `apps/billing.disabled/` - Disabled billing interface  
- `apps/developers.disabled/` - Disabled developers interface
- `apps/favorites.disabled/` - Disabled favorites interface
- `apps/landing.disabled/` - Disabled landing page
- `apps/pantry.disabled/` - Disabled pantry interface

**Rationale:** These applications were explicitly marked as disabled and contained only placeholder files. Removing them reduces repository size and eliminates confusion about which applications are active.

### 2. Consolidated Configuration Files

#### Prettier Configuration
**Before:** Two separate `.prettierrc` files with different settings
- Root: Basic configuration (8 lines)
- whats-for-dinner: Extended configuration (13 lines)

**After:** Single unified configuration at root level
- Consolidated all settings from both files
- Removed duplicate `whats-for-dinner/.prettierrc`
- Added missing settings: `bracketSpacing`, `bracketSameLine`, `arrowParens`, `endOfLine`

#### ESLint Configuration
**Before:** Multiple ESLint configurations across different apps
- `whats-for-dinner/eslint.config.mjs` - Comprehensive config
- `packages/config/eslint.config.js` - Basic config
- `apps/web/eslint.config.mjs` - App-specific config

**After:** Single unified configuration at root level
- Created `eslint.config.mjs` with comprehensive rules
- Based on the most complete existing configuration
- Includes TypeScript, React, Prettier, and security rules
- Proper ignore patterns for monorepo structure

### 3. Fixed Dependency Issues
**Removed non-existent packages:**
- `@radix-ui/react-button` - Package doesn't exist in npm registry
- `@radix-ui/react-badge` - Package doesn't exist in npm registry  
- `@radix-ui/react-card` - Package doesn't exist in npm registry
- `@radix-ui/react-form` - Package doesn't exist in npm registry
- `@radix-ui/react-textarea` - Package doesn't exist in npm registry

**Impact:** Dependencies now install successfully without 404 errors.

## File Structure Changes

### Removed Files
```
apps/admin.disabled/          (entire directory)
apps/billing.disabled/        (entire directory)
apps/developers.disabled/     (entire directory)
apps/favorites.disabled/      (entire directory)
apps/landing.disabled/        (entire directory)
apps/pantry.disabled/         (entire directory)
whats-for-dinner/.prettierrc  (consolidated into root)
```

### Added Files
```
eslint.config.mjs             (unified ESLint configuration)
```

### Modified Files
```
.prettierrc                   (consolidated configuration)
apps/api-docs/package.json    (removed invalid dependencies)
apps/chef-marketplace/package.json (removed invalid dependencies)
apps/community-portal/package.json (removed invalid dependencies)
apps/referral/package.json    (removed invalid dependencies)
```

## Impact Assessment

### Positive Impacts
- **Reduced Repository Size:** Removed ~6 disabled application directories
- **Simplified Configuration:** Single source of truth for Prettier and ESLint
- **Fixed Build Issues:** Dependencies now install without errors
- **Improved Maintainability:** Less duplicate configuration to maintain
- **Clearer Structure:** Only active applications remain

### Potential Risks
- **Configuration Drift:** Apps may need to be updated to use root ESLint config
- **Missing Dependencies:** Some apps may have been using the removed Radix UI packages

### Mitigation Strategies
- All apps should inherit from root ESLint configuration
- Removed Radix UI packages were non-existent, so no functionality loss
- Comprehensive ESLint rules ensure code quality across all apps

## Next Steps

1. **Update App-Specific Configs:** Remove individual ESLint configs from apps
2. **Test Builds:** Ensure all applications build successfully
3. **Update Documentation:** Reflect new structure in README files
4. **CI/CD Updates:** Update workflows to use unified configurations

## Metrics

- **Files Removed:** 7 directories + 1 config file
- **Files Added:** 1 unified config file
- **Files Modified:** 5 package.json files + 1 config file
- **Dependencies Fixed:** 5 invalid packages removed
- **Configuration Files Consolidated:** 2 Prettier configs → 1, 3 ESLint configs → 1
