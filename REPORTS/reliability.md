# Phase 3: SLOs & Release Gates

**Status**: ✅ Completed  
**Date**: 2024-12-19  
**Duration**: ~40 minutes

## Summary

Successfully implemented comprehensive SLO (Service Level Objectives) framework with release gates, error budget management, and automated CI checks to ensure reliability and performance standards.

## Changes Made

### 1. SLO Definitions

**SLOs.md** - Comprehensive SLO framework:
- **Availability SLOs**: 99.9% API availability, 99.5% core user journeys
- **Latency SLOs**: 95% of requests < 500ms, 95% of pages < 2s load time
- **Error Rate SLOs**: < 0.1% API error rate, < 0.5% business logic errors
- **Critical User Journeys**: 5 key user flows with specific success rates and timing
- **Error Budget Management**: Clear thresholds and consumption tracking

### 2. Critical User Journeys (CUJs)

Defined 5 critical user journeys with specific SLOs:

1. **User Registration**: 99.5% success rate, < 5s total time
2. **Meal Generation**: 99.0% success rate, < 10s total time  
3. **Payment Processing**: 99.9% success rate, < 3s total time
4. **Meal Planning**: 99.0% success rate, < 8s total time
5. **User Authentication**: 99.9% success rate, < 2s total time

### 3. Error Budget Management

**Error Budget Calculation**:
- API Availability: 43.2 minutes/month (0.1% of 30 days)
- API Latency: 5% of requests can exceed 500ms
- API Error Rate: 0.1% error rate allowed

**Error Budget Thresholds**:
- Green: < 50% consumed
- Yellow: 50-80% consumed  
- Red: 80-100% consumed
- Critical: > 100% consumed

### 4. CI Integration

**scripts/slo-check.js** - Automated SLO validation:
- SLO compliance checking
- Error budget validation
- Release gate enforcement
- Detailed reporting and recommendations
- JSON and markdown output formats

**Key Features**:
- Automated SLO validation in CI pipeline
- Error budget consumption tracking
- Release blocking conditions
- Comprehensive reporting
- Integration with existing CI/CD

### 5. Weekly Reporting

**scripts/weekly-slo-report.js** - Automated weekly reports:
- SLO performance analysis
- Error budget consumption trends
- Critical user journey metrics
- Incident tracking and analysis
- Recommendations and next steps

**Report Features**:
- Executive summary with overall status
- Detailed SLO performance metrics
- Error budget health indicators
- Critical user journey success rates
- Incident analysis and recommendations

## Metrics

### Before
- No defined SLOs or reliability targets
- No error budget management
- No release gates based on reliability
- No systematic monitoring of user journeys
- No automated reliability reporting

### After
- ✅ Comprehensive SLO framework with clear targets
- ✅ Error budget management with consumption tracking
- ✅ Release gates based on SLO compliance
- ✅ Critical user journey monitoring
- ✅ Automated weekly reporting
- ✅ CI integration for reliability checks

## Technical Implementation

### SLO Targets

#### Availability
- **API**: 99.9% (43.2 minutes downtime/month)
- **Core User Journeys**: 99.5% (3.6 hours downtime/month)

#### Latency
- **API Response**: 95% < 500ms
- **Page Load**: 95% < 2s
- **Database Queries**: 95% < 100ms

#### Error Rate
- **API Errors**: < 0.1%
- **Business Logic**: < 0.5%

### Error Budget Management

#### Calculation Formula
```
Error Budget = (100% - SLO Target) × Time Window
```

#### Consumption Tracking
- Real-time monitoring of budget consumption
- Automated alerts at 50%, 80%, and 100% thresholds
- Release blocking when budget < 20% remaining

### Release Gates

#### Pre-Release Checks
1. All SLOs within target
2. Error budget > 20% remaining
3. No performance regressions
4. No security vulnerabilities
5. All tests passing

#### Release Blocking Conditions
- Any SLO below target
- Error budget < 20%
- Performance regression > 10%
- Security vulnerabilities
- Failed tests

## Usage Examples

### SLO Check in CI
```bash
# Run SLO check
pnpm run slo:check

# Check specific SLOs
node scripts/slo-check.js --slo availability,latency
```

### Weekly Reporting
```bash
# Generate weekly report
pnpm run slo:report

# Custom date range
node scripts/weekly-slo-report.js --start 2024-12-01 --end 2024-12-07
```

### Programmatic Usage
```javascript
const { SLOChecker } = require('./scripts/slo-check.js');

const checker = new SLOChecker();
const results = await checker.runChecks();
console.log('SLO Status:', results.passed ? 'PASS' : 'FAIL');
```

## Monitoring Integration

### Metrics Collection
- **Availability**: HTTP status codes, business logic success rates
- **Latency**: Response times, database query times, page load times
- **Error Rate**: 4xx/5xx responses, business logic failures

### Alerting Thresholds
- **Warning**: 80% of error budget consumed
- **Critical**: 100% of error budget consumed
- **Emergency**: 120% of error budget consumed

### Dashboard Requirements
- Real-time SLO status
- Error budget consumption
- Trend analysis
- Historical performance
- Alert status

## Files Created

### New Files
- `SLOs.md` - Comprehensive SLO definitions and framework
- `scripts/slo-check.js` - Automated SLO validation script
- `scripts/weekly-slo-report.js` - Weekly reporting generator
- `REPORTS/reliability.md` - This report

### Modified Files
- `whats-for-dinner/package.json` - Added SLO scripts

## Validation

Run the following to validate Phase 3 completion:

```bash
# Test SLO check
pnpm run slo:check

# Test weekly report
pnpm run slo:report

# Check SLO definitions
cat SLOs.md
```

## Integration with CI/CD

### GitHub Actions Integration
```yaml
- name: SLO Check
  run: pnpm run slo:check
  if: github.event_name == 'pull_request'
```

### Release Pipeline
```yaml
- name: Pre-release SLO Check
  run: pnpm run slo:check
  if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
```
