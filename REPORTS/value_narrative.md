## One-Sentence Value Proposition

**Core Statement:**
> "What's for Dinner is the AI meal planner that learns your pantry, preferences, and cooking style—suggesting personalized recipes in seconds so you never stare at ingredients confused again."

**For B2B Partners:**
> "Turn meal planning friction into revenue. We provide the AI recipe engine that powers grocery apps and wellness platforms—handling personalization and ingredient matching so you don't have to."

**For Press/Media:**

## The Problem (Plain English)

Every day, millions of people face the same frustrating questions:
- "What can I make with these ingredients?"
- "I'm tired of the same recipes."
- "My family has dietary restrictions—what actually works?"
- "I bought ingredients but forgot what I planned to make."

Existing solutions fail because:
- **Recipe databases** (AllRecipes, Food Network) require searching, don't adapt to your pantry
- **Meal planning apps** (Yummly, Mealime) need you to know what you want before suggesting
- **Generic AI** (ChatGPT) doesn't learn your preferences or remember your pantry

**The Pain**: Decision fatigue + wasted ingredients + dietary complexity = $X billion in wasted food + hours of frustration.

---

## Our Solution (How We're Different)

**What We Do:**
We start with **what you have** (pantry ingredients) and **who you are** (dietary preferences, cooking skill, taste) to generate recipes that fit YOUR kitchen—not a generic database.

**How We're Different:**

1. **Pantry-First Approach**
   - Others: "Here are recipes, go buy ingredients"
   - Us: "Here are recipes you can make RIGHT NOW"

2. **AI That Learns**
   - Others: Static recommendations or search
   - Us: Gets smarter about your preferences with each interaction

3. **Personalized, Not Generic**
   - Others: Same recipes for everyone
   - Us: Adapts to YOUR dietary needs, skill level, time constraints

4. **Universal App**
   - Others: Web-only or mobile-only
   - Us: Works seamlessly on phone, tablet, web—syncs everywhere

**The Result:** From "staring at pantry confused" to "dinner plan ready" in 30 seconds.
