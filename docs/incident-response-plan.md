## Incident Response Process

### Phase 1: Detection (0-5 minutes)

#### Sources of Detection
- Monitoring alerts (Sentry, Vercel, UptimeRobot)
- User reports (support email, social media)
- Team members
- Automated tests

#### Initial Assessment
1. Verify incident is real (not false alarm)
2. Classify severity level
3. Determine affected systems
4. Check if issue is known

### Phase 2: Response (5-30 minutes)

#### Immediate Actions
1. **Acknowledge incident**
   - Create incident ticket
   - Notify team (Slack/PagerDuty)
   - Set status page (if needed)

2. **Assess impact**
   - Number of users affected
   - Geographic distribution
   - Feature/service affected
   - Financial impact (if applicable)

3. **Contain incident**
   - Enable rate limiting (if DDoS)
   - Disable affected feature (if needed)
   - Isolate affected systems
   - Rollback deployment (if needed)

#### Communication
- **Internal**: Notify team via Slack
- **External**: Update status page
- **Users**: Send notification if widespread

### Phase 3: Resolution (30 minutes - 24 hours)

#### Investigation
1. Collect logs and metrics
2. Reproduce issue (if possible)
3. Identify root cause
4. Develop fix

#### Implementation
1. Deploy fix to staging
2. Test fix
3. Deploy to production
4. Verify resolution

#### Monitoring
- Monitor metrics post-fix
- Watch for regressions
- Verify user reports stop

### Phase 4: Recovery (24+ hours)

#### Post-Incident
1. **Document incident**
   - Incident report
   - Root cause analysis
   - Timeline of events
   - Actions taken

2. **Review and improve**
   - What went well?
   - What could be improved?
   - Action items to prevent recurrence

3. **Follow-up**
   - Update monitoring
   - Improve alerting
   - Update documentation
   - Share learnings
