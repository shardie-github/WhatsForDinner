- ✅ Verified all referenced scripts exist
- ✅ Updated package.json scripts
- ✅ All pipeline checks configured correctly

### 4. Documentation
- ✅ RLS_MIGRATION_SUMMARY.md - Technical details
- ✅ BLOCKERS_AND_RISKS_MITIGATION.md - Risk mitigation report
- ✅ DEPLOYMENT_READINESS.md - This file

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

Before deploying to production, verify these tests pass in staging:

- [ ] Run migration in staging environment
- [ ] Execute `pnpm rls:test` - RLS smoke tests
- [ ] Execute `pnpm db:perf` - Database performance check
- [ ] Execute `pnpm health:check` - Health check
- [ ] Verify tenant isolation works (test cross-tenant access)
- [ ] Verify role permissions work (test each role)
- [ ] Check application logs for any RLS-related errors
- [ ] Test critical user workflows (create profile, add pantry items, etc.)

## 📋 Deployment Steps

### Staging Deployment

```bash
# 1. Navigate to project
cd whats-for-dinner

# 2. Run migration
supabase db push

# 3. Verify migration success
# Check for errors in supabase logs

# 4. Run validation tests
cd ..
pnpm rls:test
pnpm db:perf
pnpm health:check

# 5. Manual testing
# - Test user login
# - Test tenant creation
# - Test data access/isolation
# - Test role permissions
```

### Production Deployment

```bash
# After staging validation passes:

# 1. Schedule maintenance window
# 2. Backup database
# 3. Run migration
supabase db push --project-ref <PRODUCTION_REF>

# 4. Verify migration
# 5. Run validation tests
# 6. Monitor logs for 24 hours
```

---

## 🔍 Verification Commands

```bash
# Test RLS policies
pnpm rls:test

# Check database performance
pnpm db:perf

# Health check
pnpm health:check

# Full CI/CD validation (local)
pnpm lint && pnpm type-check && pnpm test && pnpm rls:test
```

## 📊 Migration Statistics

- **Migration File**: `014_consolidated_rls_security.sql`
- **Total RLS Operations**: 154
- **Tables Covered**: All core + multi-tenant tables
- **Roles Configured**: 4 (app_user, app_admin, app_super_admin, app_readonly)
- **Security Functions**: 7 helper functions
- **Policies Created**: Comprehensive coverage for all operations

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Migration Order**: Migration `014_consolidated_rls_security.sql` must run AFTER migrations 001-013
2. **Deprecated Migration**: Do NOT run `003_rbac_rls_security.sql` - it's deprecated
3. **Testing**: Always test in staging before production
4. **Monitoring**: Monitor application logs for RLS-related errors after deployment
5. **Rollback**: Keep database backup before running migration

---

## 🚨 Rollback Plan

If issues occur after deployment:

1. **Immediate**: Check application logs for specific errors
2. **Short-term**: If RLS blocks legitimate access, temporarily grant service_role access (emergency only)
3. **Long-term**: Rollback migration using:
   ```bash
   # Revert to previous migration state
   supabase migration repair --version <PREVIOUS_VERSION>
   ```

**Note**: Rollback should be last resort. Most issues can be fixed by adjusting policies.
