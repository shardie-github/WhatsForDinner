## The Problem (15 seconds)

**50 million Americans** face the same question every day: "What should I cook tonight?"

**Current solutions fail:**
- Recipe sites require searching (don't start with what you have)
- Meal apps need you to know what you want (planning fatigue)
- Generic AI doesn't learn your preferences (no personalization)

**Result**: Decision fatigue, wasted ingredients, repetitive meals.
