# What's for Dinner - Universal App Architecture

## 🎯 Project Overview

Successfully re-architected "What's for Dinner" into a universal Next.js + Expo application with shared design system across iOS, Android, and Web (PWA). The application now runs natively on all three platforms with a single codebase.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Development
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install
npm run install:all

# Start development
npm run dev          # All apps
npm run dev:web      # Web only
npm run dev:mobile   # Mobile only
```

### Production Build
```bash
# Build all platforms
npm run build

# Platform-specific builds
npm run build:web    # Static PWA
npm run build:mobile # Expo build
```

## 🔧 Development Workflow

### Adding Components
1. Create in `/packages/ui/src/components/YourComponent/`
2. Add `.web.tsx` and `.native.tsx` files
3. Export from main index
4. Import in apps: `import { YourComponent } from '@whats-for-dinner/ui'`

### Styling Guidelines
- Use Tailwind classes for consistency
- Platform-specific styles in separate files
- Design tokens from `/packages/theme`
- Responsive design with breakpoints

## 📊 Performance Targets

- **TTI:** < 1.2 seconds
- **Lighthouse Score:** 95+
- **Bundle Size:** Optimized with Next.js

### Mobile
- **TTI:** < 2 seconds
- **FPS:** 60fps animations
- **Bundle Size:** < 30MB (Android AAB)

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Web Testing
